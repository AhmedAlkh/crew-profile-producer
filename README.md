## Installation
As a node.js app, this generator will have to be run through the users terminal on their own machine. Clone the repository and run the app using "node index" in the terminal to invoke the app. 

## Usage
To use this app, start by entering "node index" in the command terminal. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions for each team member. After a team member is added, you will be asked if you'd like to add another one. If you answer no, the process will be complete and the HTML file will be generated in the dist folder. Right click to open the index.html file in your browser to see the results! This README.md file also includes a walkthrough video.

## Tests
All testing was done by myself (creator of the app) while writing the code. Jest was used for testing individual parts of the code.
